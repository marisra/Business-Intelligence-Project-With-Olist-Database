# Mid-term-project-plan---Business-Intelligence-with-Olist-database

Members of the group: Barbara Camean and Maris Raudlam

### Our goal: 
analyze the data, understand it, look into it, what are strengths and weaknesses of the company, try to find out things that could be improved and to give overview of the business.

### Description of the database:
We are using the Olist database to do a BI project.
The data is from kaggle.com. The database has 14 tables, 90 columns. 

### Project plan:
We will use python to join tables, clean tables and explore the data. We will not join all tables into one dataframe. We will join them according to the questions we have. For charts and dashboards we will use tableau.

- First day: exploring and understanding our data, deciding our questions and which tables to join and then starting cleaning the data (missing values, duplicates, typos, checking the data types, standardize some values if needed).
- Day 2: continue with joining and cleaning, start thinking about the charts.
- Day 3: doing the necessary charts.
- Day 4: finishing with the charts, doing the dashboards, doing a presentation for Friday.
